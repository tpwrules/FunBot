FunBot
------
FunBot is an IRC bot written in Python designed specifically for playing IRC games. It is extensible with a plugin system to add more games.
At the present moment, FunBot is stable, but not very featureful and somewhat hard to use.
Information on FunBot is in docs/FunBot.txt and writing your own plugins is covered in docs/Plugins.txt.
Run configurator.py to generate a config and user database file.
